## Introduction

This ```Database Management System``` uses ```JDBC``` to connect a java application to a ```SQL``` server with the ability to create tables, drop them, populate them, search through them, as well as adding and deleting entries. This DBMS is meant to be functional to create and manage a Point of Sale (POS) System for a store.

- ```Database Management System``` created using ```SQL``` and ```Java```.
- The ```IDE``` that was used to create the project is ```Eclipse```.
- The ```Database``` that was used for this project was ```Oracle 21c```.

This project can also be used as a framework for creating similar applications for database management in the future.

## Development 

Originally this project was meant to be created using ```Visual Studio Code``` due to the better ```Git``` integration that it provides however due to some issues with ```Maven``` and ```Visual Studio Code``` not accessing the correct ```JDBC``` driver the ```IDE``` was changed to ```Eclipse```. After the project was completed, it is also runnable on ```Visual Studio Code``` after adding the required arguments due to the use of a ```Maven``` project in ```Eclipse``` which uses the correct ```JDBC``` driver.
